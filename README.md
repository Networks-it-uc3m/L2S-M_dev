# L2S-M 
Welcome to the official repository of L2S-M, a Kubernetes operator that enables virtual networking in K8s clusters.

If you want more information about the original idea of L2S-M and its initial design, you can check our latest publication in the [IEEE Network journal](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9740640).

If you want to learn how to install L2S-M in your cluster, see the [installation guide](https://github.com/Networks-it-uc3m/L2S-M/tree/main/operator) of this repository to start its installation.

Did you already install the operator and  you cannot wait to start building your own virtual networks in your K8s cluster? Check out our [ping-pong](https://github.com/Networks-it-uc3m/L2S-M/tree/main/descriptors) example!
